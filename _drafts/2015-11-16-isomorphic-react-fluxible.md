## Isomorphic React with Fluxible.io and React-Router

Alright, time for a new blog post. I'll try to post the next one sooner, I promise.

Unless you've been living under a rock, you're aware that [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/) is the new hot thing right now in the Javascript community. If not, go read about it right now; you're missing out. I've been working with it for a few months now, and it's great. You can use React.js in many ways, but arguably the most popular one is with the [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/) architecture. There are many implementations of it, but the one we use at work is [Fluxible](http://fluxible.io/). We choose that one because it's apparently well-suited to server-side rendering.
