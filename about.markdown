Hi! You are probably here because you're wondering who is this dude whose blog you're reading. Well, you're in the right place! As you may have guessed, my name is Emile Cantin and I'm a Software Developer, Dad of four daughters and amateur sailor. I'm currently self-employed, and I help my clients push the envelope on what's possible on the Web.
