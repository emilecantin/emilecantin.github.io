Hi! You are probably here because you're wondering who is this dude whose blog you're reading. Well, you're in the right place! As you may have guessed, my name is Emile Cantin, and I'm a Software Developer, Dad of three daughters, amateur guitarist, and aspiring sailor. I currently work for [Tylio](https://www.tylio.com/), doing awesome stuff with ReactJS.
