Hi! You are probably here because you're wondering who is this dude whose blog you're reading. Well, you're in the right place!

So, my name is Emile Cantin (as you've probably guessed), and here is my story:

A long, long time ago, some youngster in high school noticed, in the margin of his math book, some text that you could apparently type in a TI graphing calculator to make it do something interesting. After a bit of messing around to figure out how exactly to enter this in his TI-80, the boy discovered a whole new world. He learned that, instead of repetitively doing the same things over and over again on his calculator, he could tell it exactly how to do something, and it would do it by itself.

One thing led to another, and not even a year later, he had gotten a new TI-89 Titanium, that you could program in C! Instead of spending hours typing on this tiny screen, you could use a real computer to type programs. One of his first programs, a Darts game, can still be found [here][darts-ticalc].

When the time came to apply to University, the boy, who had always dreamed about the sky, applied to [Universit√© de Sherbrooke][UdeS] in Mechanical Engineering. You see, he wanted to design planes. But this university required applicants to choose two programs, so he put in Computer Engineering as a second choice without much thought. He was accepted in both programs (they were evaluated separately), but someone made him notice that he was doing much more computer than mechanics in his free time. He thought about it a lot, and finally accepted the offer that was originally his second choice.

In University, he learned a lot, worked late at night, had two kids, and started a ridesharing service with six buddies (this was just before Uber, Lyft et al. were all the rage).

He now works for [Novom Networks][novom] as a Software Developer.
